### Photoshop Scripts & Panels for Comic Books Colorization 
This Section on GitHub contain the Manual installer of my Photoshop Extension dedicated to Comic Books Colorization, and it's in fact 3 sub-panels:
* **ColorizClean:** Useful if you want to clean up the lines of paper scanned pages.
* **ColorizStack:** To convert a flatten drawing (paper scanned or digital) in Structured Layers file, with tools to help to isolate areas.
* **Colorization:** Selection of tools to help in the creative part of the colorization.

The 3 sub-panels centralize all the menus, tools and features necessary to colorize comic books. The purpose of "Colorization" is mainly to save time in the process of preparing the pages for the color (clean up the lines, creating layers structure, isolations…).

The 3 **ZXP files** are the **Installers** of **Colorization**, **ColorizClean** and **ColorizStack**.
* Actually, **these Installers are the up-to-date versions of Colorization**.
* I didn't had the time yet to fix the Addon Portal version!

### Disclaimer
**I don't maintain anymore the installer of the Photoshop CS6** version of AnimDessin and AnimCouleur because my process to package/sign the extension doesn't work anymore.

So, try first the "Photoshop CS6 Installer" process and – if it doesn't work – please try the Workarounds.

### Archive: *"3 Ways to Install the CS6 Panels"*
At this date, I'm not able to export ZXP from Adobe Configurator 4!

#### *3 Possible Solutions*
1. **Simply install the Scripts and use its with no UI**
	* Copy the "Colorization_Scripts" folder from the "4-Addons-Ressources" folder in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CS6" > "Presets" > "Scripts" folder.
	* Restart Photoshop.
	* Assign Shortcuts to these Scripts using the menu "Edit" > "Keyboard Shortcuts" > "Application Menus" > "File" > "Scripts" section.
	* Copy the "Colorization_Tools.tpl" folder from the "4-Addons-Ressources" folder in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CS6" > "Presets" > "Tools" folder. *You'll need to load them from the "Tools" panel flyout menu.*
	* Copy the "Colorization.atn" folder from the "4-Addons-Ressources" folder in your Programs/Applications > "Adobe Photoshop CS6" > "Presets" > "Actions" folder. *You'll need to load them from the "Actions" panel flyout menu.*
2. **Manual process** – ***Perhaps the simpliest/quickest workaround!***
	* Unzip "ColorizClean.zip", "ColorizStack.zip" and/or "Colorization.zip" from the "2-Panels-Content" folder.
	* Move the Unzipped folder ("ColorizClean", "ColorizStack" or "Colorization") in you Applications/Programmes > "Adobe Photoshop CS6" > "Plug-ins" > "Panels" folder.
	* Copy Scripts/Tools/Actions needed by following the First Solution.
	* Restart Photoshop.
3. **Configurator Source Files Exportation**
	* Unzip "ColorizClean.zip", "ColorizStack.zip" and/or "Colorization.zip" from the "3-Configurator4-Project-Sources" folder.
	* Download and install "Adobe Configurator 4" from here: https://labs.adobe.com/downloads/configurator.html
	* It's based on the "Adobe AIR" runtime so if it's not installed on your computer you'll find it here: https://get.adobe.com/fr/air/
	* Open in Configurator "AnimDessin.gpc" or "AnimCouleur.gpc" located in the unzipped "AnimDessin" or "AnimCouleur" folder. 
	* Choose "File" > "Export Panel" and set the path location in the Applications/Programs > "Adobe Photoshop CS6" > "Plug-ins" > "Panels" folder.
	* Copy Scripts/Tools/Actions needed by following the First Solution.
	* Restart Photoshop.
	* *And you can modify the project as you wish ;-)*
